# Human-detection-and-send-Serial-Data-to-arduino-to-turn-on-off-Lights

The Arduino led light will automatically turn on if the web camera detects any Human. Otherwise, it will turn off. I have used pre trained MobileNet V3 (Mask RCNN) model. You can also do other detection according to COCO dataset. I just used it only for Humans.

Thank You
